# 09 Palindromic Strings (Part 2)

# Write another method that returns true if the string passed as an argument is
# a palindrome, false otherwise. This time, however, your method should be
# case-insensitive, and it should ignore all non-alphanumeric characters. If you
# wish, you may simplify things by calling the palindrome? method you wrote in
# the previous exercise.

# Examples:
#
# real_palindrome?('madam') == true
# real_palindrome?('Madam') == true           # (case does not matter)
# real_palindrome?("Madam, I'm Adam") == true # (only alphanumerics matter)
# real_palindrome?('356653') == true
# real_palindrome?('356a653') == true
# real_palindrome?('123ab321') == false

def real_palindrome?(str)
  string = str.downcase.gsub(/[^0-9a-z]/i, '')
  string == string.reverse
end

p real_palindrome?('madam') == true
p real_palindrome?('Madam') == true           # (case does not matter)
p real_palindrome?("Madam, I'm Adam") == true # (only alphanumerics matter)
p real_palindrome?('356653') == true
p real_palindrome?('356a653') == true
p real_palindrome?('123ab321') == false
