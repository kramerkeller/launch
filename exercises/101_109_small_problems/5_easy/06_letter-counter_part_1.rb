# Letter Counter (Part 1)

# Write a method that takes a string with one or more space separated words and
# returns a hash that shows the number of words of different sizes.

# Words consist of any string of characters that do not include a space.
#
# Examples
#
# word_sizes('Four score and seven.') == { 3 => 1, 4 => 1, 5 => 1, 6 => 1 }
# word_sizes('Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle!') == { 3 => 5, 6 => 1, 7 => 2 }
# word_sizes("What's up doc?") == { 6 => 1, 2 => 1, 4 => 1 }
# word_sizes('') == {}

# in goes a string with words
# out comes the letters size and how many of each

def word_sizes(string)
  hash = Hash.new(0)
  string.split.each { |word| hash[word.size] += 1 }
  hash
end
