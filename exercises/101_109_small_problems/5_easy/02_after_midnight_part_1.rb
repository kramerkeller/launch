# The time of day can be represented as the number of minutes before or after
# midnight. If the number of minutes is positive, the time is after midnight. If
# the number of minutes is negative, the time is before midnight.

# Write a method that takes a time using this minute-based format and returns
# the time of day in 24 hour format (hh:mm). Your method should work with any
# integer input.

# You may not use ruby's Date and Time classes.

# Examples:
#
# time_of_day(-3) == "23:57"
# time_of_day(35) == "00:35"
# time_of_day(-1437) == "00:03"
# time_of_day(3000) == "02:00"
# time_of_day(800) == "13:20"
# time_of_day(-4231) == "01:29"

  hours = (minutes / 60 % 24).to_s.rjust(2, "0")
