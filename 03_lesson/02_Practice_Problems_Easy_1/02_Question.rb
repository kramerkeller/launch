# Question 2

# 1 != is a comparison operator that denotes "not equal to" this would be
#   used in comparing to values such as 2 != 2 would be calse 2!=3 would be true

# 2 ! before a snake case means we are using ! as "not" on an object. So this
#   would be 'not' "user_name". So if "user_name" is false ""!user_name" is true

# 3 ! after a method indicates a destructive action. This will actually mutate
#   something.

# 4 ? before indicates a ternary operator

# 5 ? after something indicates we are returning a boolean

# 6 !! tells us if something is truthy?

# Launch answers that are better than mine...

# !<some object> is used to turn any object into the opposite of their boolean
# equivalent, just like the above, but opposite.

# !!<some object> is used to turn any object into their boolean equivalent.
# (Try it in irb)
